- 👋 Hi, I’m Twahirwa
- 👀 I love sharing my knowledge, it could be of help to someone out there ...
- 🌱 I currently code as a pastime, but I have previously been a key member on some software development projects ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am multi-talented, but you have to be a little close to me & like-minded to know all my abilities ...
